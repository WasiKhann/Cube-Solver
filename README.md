# Cube-Solver
CubeSolver is a Python-based project designed to solve a Rubik's Cube using heuristic methods. The project implements the COH and EOH heuristics as well as a hybrid approach to find solutions efficiently. The repository contains multiple scripts that work together to solve the Rubik's Cube, including versions with different implementations and optimizations.

## Features

- **COH Heuristic:** Implemented in `CubeCOH.py` to find efficient solutions.
- **EOH Heuristic:** Implemented in `CubeEOH.py` for alternative solving methods.
- **Main Solver:** The primary solving logic is in `CubeSolver.py`.
- **Support Functions:** Additional functionalities in `SolveCube.py`.

## Repository Structure

- `CubeSolver.py`: Main script for solving the Rubik's Cube.
- `SolveCube.py`: Additional functionalities and support for solving the cube.
- `CubeCOH.py`: Implementation of the COH heuristic.
- `CubeEOH.py`: Implementation of the EOH heuristic.
- `README.md`: Documentation and instructions for the project.
- `.ReadMe.txt`: Additional notes and version information.
- `CubeSolver.cpython-310.pyc`: Compiled Python file.


Instructions to run:
Run the individual python file.
Enter scrambled cube state in the input field window popup.
Example input: RRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYY


Note: All code versions have same input and output format.
This was an artificial intelligence final project.
No information online was found for this as this application and heuristic chosen wasn't commonly chosen due to it's challenging implementation in this context.
It took several trial and errors to come up with a reasonable solution.
This repo contains all the versions of codes for COH and EOH and their hybrid model to showcase the progress.
